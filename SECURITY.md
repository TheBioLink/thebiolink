## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Disclosure Process
We follow a **coordinated disclosure** model. We will work with you to verify, fix, and responsibly disclose the issue. Public disclosure will only occur after a fix is available for all supported versions (4.1.x–5.2.x), unless otherwise agreed.

> **Important:** There are **no known unfixed vulnerabilities** in currently supported versions. All patched issues are documented in release notes, and **all devices running supported versions (4.1–5.2) with the latest updates are considered safe to use**.
